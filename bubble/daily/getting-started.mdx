## What is Daily?

[Daily](https://www.daily.co/) is a video and audio chat platform for seamless real-time communication. The Daily plugin for Bubble is maintained by [Lunch Pail Labs](https://www.lunchpaillabs.com).

## What's in the plugin?

The free **Daily plugin** covers most core video and audio use cases in your Bubble app.

With the plugin, you can:

- Create and manage **video and audio calls**.
- Implement **room-based** conferencing.
- Control participants with **mute**, **screen share**, and more.
- Add **live streaming** and **meeting recording**.

## Installation and Setup

You can install the Daily plugin from the [Bubble Marketplace](https://bubble.io/plugin/daily-video-chat-1622494385281x917140771709124600). Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Create a Daily Account**: If you don’t have one, [sign up for Daily](https://dashboard.daily.co/u/signup).
2. **Retrieve Your API Key**: After signing in, navigate to the [Daily Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.daily.co/developers) and copy your API key.
3. **Configure the Plugin in Bubble**: In your Bubble app, paste the API key into the plugin’s settings, prefixing it with `Bearer` (e.g., `Bearer 4ffad...`).

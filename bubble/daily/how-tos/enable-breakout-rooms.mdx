Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

## 1. Enable breakout rooms in room settings

When creating or updating a room, set the `enable breakout rooms` field to `yes` in the [create room](/bubble/daily/plugin-reference/actions/create-room) or [update room](/bubble/daily/plugin-reference/actions/update-room) actions.

## 2. Create a meeting token for the room owner

To allow someone to create breakout rooms, they need to be the room owner. Use the [create meeting token](/bubble/daily/plugin-reference/actions/create-meeting-token) action, set the `room name` to the room created in [Step 1](#1-enable-breakout-rooms-in-room-settings), and mark `is owner` as `yes`.

## 3. Join the room with the meeting token

Next, join the room using the [join room](/bubble/daily/plugin-reference/actions/join-room) action. The user creating the breakout rooms must use the meeting token from [Step 2](#2-create-a-meeting-token-for-the-room-owner) and the room name from [Step 1](#1-enable-breakout-rooms-in-room-settings).

title: "How to Get the Record Structure"
---

SmartSuite is a flexible and powerful tool, and SmartSuite tables have various data structures. To display a group of records in your Bubble app, you need to ensure Bubble knows the structure of the data it should expect. This is where the action to get the record structure for your table comes into play. This short how-to demonstrates how to do it.

## Steps

1. **Create a Display Page**

   - Create a page to display the data type.
   - Add a text element with a custom state named 'format'.
   - Set the text element's content to 'Text A's format'.
   - Refer to the video demonstration: [video.mp4](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/480f0932-72ea-496f-a70d-3632da8d6e99/82789c98-a4eb-4947-9da1-0ded62e8f4ff/video.mp4).

2. **Set Up the Workflow**

   - Create a workflow with two actions on page load:
     1. 'SmartSuite - Fetch Table'
     2. 'Set State of Text A' using the results of the first step as the state value.
   - Refer to the video demonstration: [Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/480f0932-72ea-496f-a70d-3632da8d6e99/6be7b0ab-7ba6-44cb-a7a4-9a87a1ed476c/Untitled.mp4).

3. **Import the Data Format**
   - Copy the data format and add it to the API Connector.
   - Refer to the video demonstration: [Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/480f0932-72ea-496f-a70d-3632da8d6e99/748d8b00-8fc3-4a12-92b4-fcb75e2ebb2a/Untitled.mp4).

This guide will help you get started with building real-time collaborative features like presence and live cursors in your Bubble app.

## What is Liveblocks?

[Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io/) is a platform that allows users to add collaborative features to their products, such as comments, notifications, and real-time APIs.

## What's in the plugin?

The free Liveblocks plugin implements a small portion of what is possible with Liveblocks and is maintained by [Lunch Pail Labs](https://www.lunchpaillabs.com). With [Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io), users can:

- See who is online and track their activity with **presence**.
- Watch each other’s **live cursor** movements across the page in real-time.
- Create and update **Liveblocks rooms** directly from within Bubble, enabling dynamic, shared experiences for your users.

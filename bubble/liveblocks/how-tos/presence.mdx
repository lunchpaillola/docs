title: "Use the presence element"
---

import liveblocksFooter from "/snippets/liveblocksFooter.mdx";

One of the first features you’ll likely want to use after setting up Liveblocks in your app is the [presence element](/bubble/liveblocks/plugin-reference/elements/liveblocks-presence). Presence lets you track who’s on a page and can be used to create features like:

- **Activity indicators**: Show which users are currently active or idle.
- **Online statuses**: Display whether users are online, offline, or away.
- **Collaborative editing indicators**: Highlight when multiple users are viewing or editing the same document or page.

## What we'll build

This tutorial covers how we set up presence in the demo app. For the exact setup from this tutorial, visit the [tutorial demo editor](https://bubble.io/page?id=lpl-liveblocks&tab=tabs-2&name=presence-tutorial&type=page), or [try the live demo](https://lpl-liveblocks.bubbleapps.io/version-test/live-cursors).

![Live demo of presence](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726672111/demoofthelivepresense_uhj5zw.gif)

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install and set up the plugin:

If you haven’t already installed the Liveblocks plugin, you can find a step-by-step guide [here](/bubble/liveblocks/how-tos/set-up-plugin).

## Database

### 2. Set up the database

In this demo, we’ll display users that visit the page. To do this, we need to update the `User` data type in the database by adding a `name` and a `profile image`.

Go to the **Data** tab and create two new fields:

- `name` of type `text`
- `profile image` of type `image`

![data tab](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670058/database_1_u1yeyu.png)

### 3. Update the privacy settings

For this demo, we’ll make the user data public to avoid setting up a login system. Go to the **Privacy** tab and check `View all fields` and `Find in searches` for everyone.

⚠️ In a production app, be more careful with privacy settings to protect user data.

![privacy settings](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670057/database_2_hfsg1c.png)

### 4. Add sample data

Finally, add some user data. You can copy the [CSV file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xd2Dz6gGAWNcrIb_wGV4Y_vAr_8jDHDF/view?usp=sharing) and upload it into Bubble if you have a paid plan or trial, or manually add at least three users for this demo.

## Design

Next is a simple design for the page. While not essential for using presence, it’s needed for the demonstration. If you want to skip ahead to the element setup, jump to the [section on adding the presence element](#5-adding-the-liveblocks-presence-element).

### 3. Create a New Page

In your Bubble app, create a new page.

![Create a new page](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670053/presence_s1_rx5aol.png)

Give the page a name. For this tutorial, I’m calling it `presence-tutorial`.

![Name the page](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670515/presence_s2_bq8xyr.png)

### 4. Setting up the page

Change the layout of the page. Click on the page until the property editor opens, then go to the **Layout** tab and select `column` instead of `fixed`.

![set up the page](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670516/presence_s3_jmprdd.png)

### 5. Adding the Liveblocks presence element

Add a hidden popup to house the presence element. This keeps it organized and out of the way.

Drag a popup onto your page and rename it `hidden popup`.

![add popup](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670054/presence_s4_eeai8n.png)

Search for `liveblocks-presence` and drag it into the popup to track who’s online.

![add presence element](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670053/presence_s5_pzq0sd.png)

### 6. Add a floating group

Create a `floating group` that will later house our repeating group for avatars.

Search for `floating group` in your assets and drag it onto the page. In the **Appearance** tab, set the following:

- Vertically float relative to: `top`
- Horizontally float relative to: `left`
- Floating z-index: `above elements`

![screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670054/presence_s6_u4vjsx.png)

In the **Layout** tab, uncheck `make this element fixed-width` and `fixed-height`. Set the `min-width` to 100% and `min-height` to 100px, then check `fit height to content`.

![screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670053/presence_s7_kvsekl.png)

### 7. Add a repeating group

Add a `repeating group` from the assets to the `floating group`. Set the **type of content** to `text` and the **data source** to `Liveblocks-presence (testing) A's everyone`. This data source holds all users in the room, including the local user.

In the **Appearance** tab, set the following:

- Check `set fixed number of rows`
- Set `rows` to 1
- Uncheck `set fixed number of columns`
- Set `minimum width of the column` to 20%
- Set `separators` to `none`
- Set `border` to `none`

![screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670058/presence_s8_n9gqkb.png)

In the **Layout** tab, set the following:

- Set `cell's container layout` to `column`
  - Set `container alignment` to `top`
- Check `element is visible on page load`
- Uncheck `make this element fixed-width`
- Uncheck `make this element fixed-height`
- Set `min height` to 0
- Check `fit height to content`

![screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670058/presence_s9_jx7sfl.png)

### 8. Create the avatar

Create a `group user` that will display the profile image of users when they are on the page.

Add a group to the repeating group, name it `group user`, and set the **type of content** to `user`.

![screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670058/presence_s10_n3mmce.png)

Set the data source to `do a search for`, make the **type** `user`, and set the unique id to `current cell's text`. This data source is a list of user IDs (which we'll set later), matching Bubble's unique IDs.

![screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670059/presensce_s11_qirgnm.png)

Add an `image` element to the `group user` and set the image to `Parent group's user's profile image`. Enable **Imgix** and the following settings:

- Check `auto enhance the image`
- Set `quality` to 100
- Check `resize to fit dimensions by cropping`
- Check `apply a circle/ellipse mask`

![screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670059/presence_s12_jvdxyy.png)

Add a border with `solid color #177db4e` and set a tooltip to display the `parent group's user's name`.

![screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670060/presence_s13_ezeiiv.png)

In the **Layout** tab, set the **width** to 50px, check `keep element aspect ratio fixed`, and set the aspect ratio to `1x1`.

![screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670063/presence_s14_hmisfx.png)

That's it for setting up the design!

## Workflows

Workflows are where most of the interaction with Liveblocks will happen.

### 9. Create a room

Create a workflow that runs on page load to create a room for the demo.

On page load, add the `Liveblocks - create room` action. Set the `Room ID` to `tutorial` and the `Default Access` to `public`.

Add a new event: `When page is loaded`.

![when page is loaded](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670062/presence_s15_bruk8w.png)

Then add the `Liveblocks - create room` action.

![create room action](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670061/presence_s16_qfhtux.png)

Add the [Air Alert plugin](https://bubble.io/plugin/airalert-1515787032525x876315403042684900) for confirmation. We'll use it to show an alert with the room name after the room is created.

![air alert action](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670063/presence_s17_tnmcn5.png)

Preview the page to confirm that the room was created successfully.

![preview the page](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670062/presence_s18_mvejfk.png)

Great! Now that the room is created, we can move on to entering the room.

### 10. Workflow to enter a room

You can now disable the `on page load` workflow—we won't need it anymore since our room is created.

![Disable on page load workflow](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670062/presence_s19_gsbz6y.png)

Create a new `page is loaded` workflow. We will add an action to set the state of an element. In Bubble, states allow you to store information within elements. For this demo, we'll use states to store a random user ID from our database to simulate a random user. In a real production app, you'd use the current user's unique ID, but we're avoiding login for this tutorial.

Add a new action to set the state of an element:

![Set the state of an element](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670061/presence_s20_piviq1.png)

Set the element in the action's property editor to `presence-tutorial`, then create a new custom state:

![Create a new custom state](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670061/presence_s21_bbumi9.png)

Call the state `User ID` and make it of type `text`.

![Set the state to User ID](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670061/presence_s22_sikbnm.png)

Add an action to set the state of the element to a random user ID.

![Set state to random user ID](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670065/presence_s23_t9ddxx.png)

Add the `authorize user` action—this authorizes users in Bubble with Liveblocks.

- For the `user ID` field, use the `User ID` state we just created.
- For the `Room ID`, use the `tutorial` room you created.
- Set `permissions` to `FULL_ACCESS`.

![Authorize user action](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670066/presence_s24_l17qgy.png)

Add the `create client` action—this creates an instance of Liveblocks in Bubble. The `ID token` is the result of the user you just authorized. You can leave `throttle` and `lost connection time` as is. Learn more about the parameters of the `create client` action [here](/bubble/liveblocks/plugin-reference/elements/liveblocks-presence#create-client).

![Create client action](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1726670065/presense_s25_vsfkq5.png)

Add the `enter room` action. This is what joins the user in the room. Enter the `Room ID` and `User ID`, and keep the rest as default. Learn more about the advanced settings (e.g., live cursors) in [this tutorial](/bubble/liveblocks/how-tos/live-cursors).

## Demo

### 11. Trying it out

Select `preview` and you should see the page load with your avatar at the top. Open several tabs to see the users on the page update in real time!

## Next Steps

Now that you've got presence running, kick it up a notch with [live cursors](/bubble/liveblocks/how-tos/live-cursors).

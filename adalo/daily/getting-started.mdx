## About the Component

The Daily Kit for Adalo lets you add video chat functionality to your Adalo app in minutes.

[Daily](https://www.daily.co/) is a company that lets you add WebRTC video and audio to your apps and create live video experiences.

With this kit, you’ll be able to embed [Daily Prebuilt](https://www.daily.co/prebuilt), which comes automatically with a pre-join call UX, chat and participant views, and host controls.

This component is developed and managed by [Lunch Pail Labs](https://lunchpaillabs.com/), a Daily development partner and software service specializing in building and managing SaaS integrations. For any help with this component, contact [help@lunchpaillabs.com](mailto:help@lunchpaillabs.com) or add a question to the [forum discussion](https://forum.adalo.com/t/coming-soon-free-daily-co-video-chat-component/24154).

## Getting Started with the Component

Before getting started, you’ll want to make sure you have a Daily account. You can sign up for an account on [Daily’s website](https://dashboard.daily.co/signup).

You’ll also want to save your API key, which you can find in your [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.daily.co/developers). You’ll need this key for all the button actions.
